# hello-world

Just editing this for the tutorial. Learning GitHub is fun!
I hope you're having a great day whoever you are. It could be me, but also could be you.
And if it's you, just know I think you're great. You really are. There isn't any one like you.
You are you. 
Something to remember when feeling blue or haven't got a clue.
This is the first time someone is you.
And for that reason you deserve to know how everything turns out.
